# Run this script in an active Spack environment to fetch Go dependencies and
# store them in $GOMODCACHE. You must either run it with 'spack-python' or have
# 'spack-python' in your $PATH. Ensure $GOMODCACHE has the same value when
# 'spack install' is run.
#
# For each spec that is a GoPackage, it will attempt to use that spec's
# 'go' dependency to execute '', but will fall back to searching
# $PATH if that dependency has not already been installed.
